# Hristo-CSharp-Portfolio-Advanced
This portfolio demonstrates my practical skills as a Junior C# Developer through several console applications. The projects demonstrate OOP, inheritance, LINQ, CRUD operations, and file storage.  I am currently expanding my skills with ASP.NET Core and databases and am looking for first job or internship opportunities.
